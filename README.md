# 100 Math Questions for Machine Learning ("機械学習の数理100問")

I will try to solve 100 questions in the problem set created by Professor Joe Suzuki. 
You can find his blog here: http://joe.bayesnet.org/

The purpose of this trial is to understand basic mathematics for machine learning 
and to learn how to implement machine learning techniques with R.
I make this repository public to keep my motivation.

Note:
- I am lazy, so I do not know when I will have finished the problem set (or never).
- There should be errors in my answer.
- I am always ready to remove this repository if ordered by the professor.
